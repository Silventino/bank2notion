# Bank 2 Notion

## Description

This is an app that allows you to import the data of your bank PDFs (bank statement or card invoice) to a Notion database.

For now, it only works with the Brazilian banks Nubank and Ita√∫, but adding more banks is easy and I'm open to pull requests.

To use it, head to [bank2notion.web.app](https://bank2notion.web.app) and follow the instructions. You'll need:

1. A Notion account
2. A Notion integration ([know more](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration#create-your-integration-in-notion))
3. A Notion API key ([know more](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration#get-your-api-secret))
4. The Notion database ID of the database you'll insert the data ([know more](https://developers.notion.com/reference/retrieve-a-database#:~:text=To%20find%20a%20database%20ID,a%2032%20characters%20alphanumeric%20string.))
5. The PDF you want to import
